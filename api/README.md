# OpenAPI generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
alembic upgrade head
python3 -m openapi_server
```
If you're seeing error messages, this may be related to missing environment variables. In the ``api/`` directory create a ``.env`` file and copy and paste the variable definitions from ``.env.example``. Message a team member to receive the necessary values.
 
and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/ui/
```

Your OpenAPI definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/openapi.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Alembic migrations
When changing the database, you can automatically generate an alembic migration. Simply change the model however you want in `database.py`, run `alembic revision --autogenerate -m <name_of_migration>` to generate a new migration, and then run `alembic upgrade head` to upgrade your database to the latest revision.
In the case of someone else adding a revision to the database, simply pull their changes to your repo and run `alembic upgrade head` to upgrade your local database to the latest revision.

## Making changes to the openapi specification
In order to make changes to the openapi specification you should edit the files within the `openapi_server/openapi` folder.
You should NOT make any manual changes to the file in the `_spec` folder, as this is an auto-generated file compiled from the smaller files in the `openapi` folder.

After making your changes, you can recompile the file in the `_spec` folder by running the following command:
```
swagger-cli bundle openapi_server/openapi/openapi.yaml \
    --outfile openapi_server/_spec/openapi.yaml \
    --type yaml
```

If you do not have `swagger-cli` installed, you can install it with the following command:
```
npm install -g swagger-cli
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t openapi_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 openapi_server
```
