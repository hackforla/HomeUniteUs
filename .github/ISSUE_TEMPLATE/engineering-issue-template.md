### üìê Scope of Work

Clearly define what‚Äôs in scope for this issue.
- Create form fields dynamically from schema
- Implement save progress functionality (autosave and manual)
- Add validation rules as defined in the schema
- Ensure user authentication is respected
- Set up database schema if not yet implemented

### üîß Engineering Tasks

<!-- Actionable dev steps for implementation. Include backend, frontend, tests, etc. -->
### Steps to Implement 
-[Add engineering action items here] Such as:
- [ ] Implement backend logic for profile update
- [ ] Add UI form fields (email, display name)
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend endpoint
- [ ] Add input validation on frontend
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests
- [ ] Deploy under feature flag
- [ ] Update API docs if applicable

---

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

<!-- List of clear, testable criteria. Use checkboxes. -->

- [ ] xxx
- [ ] xxx
- [ ] xxx
- [ ] xxx

### üîÑ Dependencies
- Select "dependency" label and move this section to the top of the page.  Describe the dependency or link to the issue that is blocking this one from proceeding. 

---

### üì¶ Technical Notes

Engineering team should document their approach here, such as:
- Component hierarchy or file structure plan
- Libraries or dependencies needed
- How local state and API responses will be managed
- Planned test coverage
- API endpoint: 
- Feature flag: 
- Known limitations: 

---

### üß™ Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for form logic and validation
- Integration test with backend service
- Cross-browser UI check
- Responsive layout testing (mobile, tablet, desktop)

---

### üö© Risks / Considerations

- API spec not finalized ‚Äì may need adjustments
- Edge case for conditional fields requires backend logic
- DB schema must be deployed first

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment & Compliance Considerations
- **Security Impact:** (e.g., new endpoints, data exposure, authentication changes?)
- **Data Privacy:** (Does it handle PII or sensitive data? Do we need a DPA update?)
- **Regulatory Impact:** (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.)
- **Third-Party Tools:** (Any new integrations needing legal/security review?)
- **Accessibility Concerns:** (Does this meet WCAG/ADA standards?)
- **Rollback Plan:** (What‚Äôs the mitigation if something goes wrong?)
