### ‚úÖ Success Criteria (Design-Specific)
*Validates that the design work itself is complete and meets quality standards (completed by PM) *
- [ ] Addresses the core user problem
- [ ] Aligns with product vision and brand guidelines
- [ ] Meets accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Can be handed off to Engineering with clear assets and specs

---

### üìã Functional Requirements (if applicable)
*Only include if there are specific technical or business constraints that affect the design solution*
- Data fields that must be captured (for compliance/integration reasons)
- Required integrations with existing systems
- Specific user flows that cannot be changed due to technical constraints

---

### üß© Functional Constraints
