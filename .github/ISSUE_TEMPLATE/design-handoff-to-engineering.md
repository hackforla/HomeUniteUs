- Modal/dropdown opening and closing behavior
- State changes (enabled/disabled, selected/unselected)
- Page-to-page navigation and transitions
- Animation and transition requirements
- Form validation timing and error display
- Loading states and progress indicators

Specific interactions for this feature:
- [ ] [User action]: [Expected system response]
- [ ] [Interface element]: [Behavior in different states]
- [ ] [Form/input]: [Validation and feedback timing]

### âœ… UX Acceptance Checklist
*Completed by Design Team Member - modify accordingly*
- [ ] Visual design QA complete 
    - (Verify that all visual elements match the approved designs, including spacing, typography, colors, and component usage. Check that interactive states (hover, focus, active, disabled) are clearly defined and any design system components are properly specified).
- [ ] Copy finalized 
    - (Confirm that all text content is final and approved - no placeholder text, lorem ipsum, or "TBD" copy remains. This includes labels, buttons, error messages, tooltips, and any microcopy. If copy is still being refined, note what's pending and when it will be finalized.)
- [ ] Accessibility reviewed (basic standards) 
    - (Ensure the design meets fundamental accessibility requirements: sufficient color contrast ratios, keyboard navigation considered, meaningful alt text planned for images, and form labels properly associated. Flag any potential accessibility concerns for developer attention.)
- [ ] Edge cases covered 
    - (Document how the design handles uncommon but important scenarios such as: very long text/names, empty data states, error conditions, slow loading, offline states, and boundary conditions (minimum/maximum values). List the specific edge cases considered for this feature.)
- [ ] Placeholder behavior confirmed (empty states, loading, etc.) 
    - (Define what users see during transitional states: loading spinners or skeletons while data loads, empty state messaging when no content exists, form validation feedback, and any progressive disclosure patterns. Include specific copy and visual treatment for these states.)
- [ ] Responsive behavior documented (if applicable) 
     - (Specify how the design adapts across different screen sizes and devices. Include breakpoint behavior, layout changes, content prioritization, and any mobile-specific interactions. Document which elements stack, hide, or transform on smaller screens, and note any touch-specific considerations like minimum tap target sizes.)
- [ ] Design tokens/specifications provided for developers
    - (Include precise technical specifications developers need for implementation: exact spacing values, font sizes, color hex codes, border radius, shadow values, and animation timing. Reference specific design system tokens where applicable or provide explicit measurements when custom styling is required.)

### ðŸ§ª Known Edge Cases or Special Logic
*(Design/Product provide initial information, Engineering to add any technical cases)*
*Document unusual scenarios and custom business rules that require specific handling. Include both the condition and expected behavior.* 

Highlight any non-obvious logic or conditional behaviors:
- Conditional field rendering
- Required vs optional inputs
- Scroll behavior or sticky elements
- Form submission triggers

Examples to consider:
- Data validation boundaries (character limits, format requirements)
- User behavior scenarios (rapid clicking, navigation during processes)
- System failure states (API errors, network issues)
- Business rule exceptions (user role differences, geographic restrictions)
- Integration-specific requirements

List specific cases for this feature:
- [ ] [Condition]: [Expected behavior]
- [ ] [Condition]: [Expected behavior]

### ðŸ›  Dev/Engineering Notes (Optional) 
*Engineering to provide - any known technical constraints, performance considerations, or anticipated pain points. 
*Technical implementation details, constraints, and guidance specifically for the development team. This section bridges the gap between design intent and technical execution by providing engineering-specific context that isn't captured elsewhere. *
*Dev/Engineering Notes = "How to build it within our technical ecosystem"  i.e "Here are the technical things the dev team should know while building this feature."*

Examples of what to include:
- Framework/library requirements or preferences
- Performance considerations and optimization notes
- Integration details (APIs, database changes, third-party services)
- Browser/device support requirements
- Implementation phases or priorities (MVP vs. nice-to-have)
- Technical gotchas, limitations, or workarounds needed

Specific technical guidance:
- [ ] [Implementation detail]: [Specific guidance or constraint]
- [ ] [Technical requirement]: [Why it's needed or how to approach]
- [ ] [Integration note]: [What developers need to know]

### ðŸš© Risks / Considerations
* Engineering to provide - Note potential challenges specific to implementing this feature. *
Examples of what to include:
- Dependencies that must be completed first
- Unfinalized specs that may change
- Complex logic requiring coordination between teams
- Technical constraints specific to this feature

Feature-specific items:
- [ ] [Feature-specific risk]: [How it might impact implementation]
- [ ] [Feature constraint]: [What developers should know]
- [ ] [Feature dependency]: [What this relies on] Select "dependency" label and move this to the top, before "Overview" section.
