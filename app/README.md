# Home Unite Us Frontend App

Before getting started, make sure you have followed the instructions in the [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.

You will also need to ask a member of team for a copy of the `.env` file, and a Node.js version compatible with 14.18+, 16+. You can check your local version by running the following command in a terminal:

```terminal
node --version
```

## Local Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository to a directory on your computer
2. Inside a terminal change directories to the root ``HomeUniteUs/`` directory
3. Navigate to the the ``app/`` directory ``cd app/``
4. Run the command ```npm install``` to download all dependencies from the local package.json
5. Create a local ``.env`` file and copy the contents from ``.env.example``
6. Message a team member to obtain values for the .env file
7. From the ``app/`` directory run ``npm run dev`` to start a development server at ``http://127.0.0.1:4040/``

The setup for the front end application is now complete and you should see the website running in your browser at the listed port.

## Testing

Within this (`app`) directory, run the command: `npm test`.
