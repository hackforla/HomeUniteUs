## Installation instructions

1. Step-by-step instructions help new contributors get a development environment up and running quickly.
2. You'll want to find the balance between being specific enough for novices to follow, without being so specific that you reinvent the wheel by providing overly-basic instructions that can be found elsewhere.
3. Feel free to adapt this section and its sub-sections to your own processes.
4. Alternatively, you can move everything from *Installation instructions* through *Testing* to a separate **Contributing.md** file to keep your **ReadMe.md** more succinct.
