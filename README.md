# Home Unite Us

We're working with community non-profits who have a host home initiative to develop a workflow management tool to make the process scaleable (across all providers), reduce institutional bias, and effectively capture data.

Host home programs are centered around housing young people, 18 - 25 years old. Their approach focuses on low-cost, community-driven intervention by matching a willing host with a guest or group of guests, providing a stable housing environment for youths who are experiencing homelessness and seeking stable housing.

### Project context

This project is part of a larger initative at Hack for LA around creating a shared housing application, that can be used by organizations accross the county to help people tranisition to living independently and sustainably through host homes, empty bedrooms, and roomate matching for shared housing with lease signing.

## Installation instructions

1. Step-by-step instructions help new contributors get a development environment up and running quickly.
2. You'll want to find the balance between being specific enough for novices to follow, without being so specific that you reinvent the wheel by providing overly-basic instructions that can be found elsewhere.
3. Feel free to adapt this section and its sub-sections to your own processes.
4. Alternatively, you can move everything from _Installation instructions_ through _Testing_ to a separate **Contributing.md** file to keep your **ReadMe.md** more succinct.
